In this repository I gather my extensions to [PyTorch](http://pytorch.org). 
The packaging structure tries to reproduce PyTorch's structure in order 
to facilitate usage for people familiar with PyTorch. In the following 
a list of its main features (admitably short ... yet ;) ).

1. `nn.SLayer`:
this is an input layer which can operate on multi sets of points of some 
cartesian product of the real numbers. Its primary intention is to train 
networks on the output of a topological data analysis pipeline, but can 
be used on arbitrary multi set input, like mentioned above. 
See [Deep Learning with Topological Signatures](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.04041) for 
futher reading. 

The folder *tutorials* contains minimalistic examples in form of jupyter notebooks
to improve usability.
