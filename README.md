In this repository I gather my extensions to [PyTorch](http://pytorch.org). 
The packaging structure tries to reproduce PyTorch's structure in order 
to facilitate usage for people familiar with PyTorch. 

## Documentation

[Read the docs!](https://c-hofer.github.io/chofer_torchex/)

The folder *tutorials* contains some minimalistic examples in form of Jupyter notebooks
to demonstrate how to use the `PyTorch` extensions. 

## Associated publications

If you use any of these extensions, please cite the following works (depending on which functionality you use, obviously :)
